## 🧱 Clean Architecture in Android with Kotlin

Clean Architecture in Android prioritizes:

- 🎯 **Distinct Roles**: Unique purpose for each layer.
- 🔒 **Layer Autonomy**: Pure Kotlin/Java in core layers.
- 🧪 **Testability**: Fostering reliability.
- 🚀 **Adaptive Design**: Ready for tech shifts and requirements.

###   The Three Layers

- **UI Layer**: Interactive & visually captivating.
- **Domain Layer**: The business logic hub.
- **Data Layer**: Manages all data sources.

#### 🎨 The UI Layer

Here's a look at the tools and practices shaping the UI:

- 🎨 **Jetpack Compose**: For a modern, declarative UI.
- 🗃️ **ViewModels**: Acting as state holders.
- 🌊 **Kotlin Flow & StateFlow**: For data streams and state management.


#### 💼 The Domain Layer

The domain layer is the backbone:

- 📚 **Pure Kotlin**: For a platform-agnostic core.
- ⚙️ **Use Cases**: Distinct operations encapsulating business rules.
- 🧪 **Unit Testing**: For validating each use case.
- 🚀 **Decoupling**: Ensuring stability and consistency.


#### 💾 The Data Layer

The data layer stands as a pivotal component:

- 🗂️ **Repository Pattern**: For clean data access.
- 🌐 **Ktor**: Handling API calls.
- 📦 **Room**: Local data storage.
